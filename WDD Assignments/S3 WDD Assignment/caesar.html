<h1>What is the Caeser Cipher?</h1>
<p> 
The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encrypting text. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (plaintext) is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

 

For example, with a shift value of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The last three letters of the alphabet wrap around to the beginning, so X is substituted with A, Y with B, and Z with C. 

 

To encrypt a message, you pick a shift value (e.g. 3) and substitute each letter in the plaintext by shifting it that number of positions in the alphabet. To decrypt, you reverse the process with the same shift value, moving each letter back the same number of positions. 

 

The cipher gets its name from Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it with a shift of 3 for confidential military communications. While extremely simple, it introduces the basic concept of substitution ciphers that are used in more advanced encryption schemes.
